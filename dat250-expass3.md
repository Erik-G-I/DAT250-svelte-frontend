#Technical issues

No real technical issues, but it took some time to figure out the basics of svelte and the fetch() function.

#Pending issues

Did not really have time to finish this assignment, but it ws exciting to connect the frontend to the backend!
I am however not sure what the best way to update the application is. I imagine the updating of votes should be done on the frontend
so it reacts instantly without having to fetch the updated votecount from the backend.
